# TBD
2d, adventure oriented game
- Player moves from town to town, with paths separating each town.
- Each path has 5-10 encounters: battle, treasure, dialog
- Each town has a store 
- Battle is turn based, order is speed+agility dependent
- Dialog with new playable characters:
  - Can result in convincing them to join, getting attacked by them, or neither. Depending on the player's dialog decisions
  - Each dialog decision gets some numeric value, if at the end it is above a certain threshold the character joins, if below a certain threshold the character attacks
- Social skills: on level up the player gets social points he can add to skills such as bluff, intimidate, beg, flattery, logic, etc. The level of these skills
  affect the options a player can use in dialog (must cross certain threshold to use certain dialog options)
- Sneak skill determines if the player reached the battle area undetected. If so he can sneak attack or set a trap depending on the difference between his sneak and
  the opponent's perception. Each trap requires different sneak according to how hard it is to set up
- ??? Instead of buying equipment you upgrade it. This will save us getting assets for equipment, setting all their values and changing the appearnce of the characters
  - Armor upgrade has 2 options:
    - Bulk-Up: Increases defence but also speed penalty
    - Strip-Down: Decreases speed penalty but also defence
    - Notes:
      - Bulk-Up and Strip-Down do not cancel each other out
      - Bulk-Up should be more dominant since defence can go really high but speed penalty shouldn't be that high
  - Weapon upgrade has 2 options:
    - Bulk-Up: Increases damage but also energy cost of moves
    - Strip-Down: Decreases energy cost but also damage
    - Notes:
      - Bulk-Up and Strip-Down do not cancel each other out
      - Bulk-Up should be more dominant since damage can go really high but energy cost shouldn't be that high
