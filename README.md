2d, adventure oriented game
- Player moves from town to town, with paths separating each town.
- Each path has 5-10 encounters: battle, treasure, dialog
- Each town has a store 
- Battle is turn based, order is speed+agility dependent
- Dialog with new playable characters:
  - Can result in convincing them to join, getting attacked by them, or neither. Depending on the player's dialog decisions
  - Each dialog decision gets some numeric value, if at the end it is above a certain threshold the character joins, if below a certain threshold the character attacks
- Social skills: on level up the player gets social points he can add to skills such as bluff, intimidate, beg, flattery, logic, etc. The level of these skills
  affect the options a player can use in dialog (must cross certain threshold to use certain dialog options)
